# raft-dezyne-model

This repository contains a Dezyne model of the Raft consensus algorithm.

[Consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)) is a fundamental problem in distributed computing and multi-agent systems. 

	Objective of consensus algorithms is to achieve overall system reliability in the presence of a number of faulty processes. 

[Raft](https://raft.github.io) is a proven and reasonably understandable consensus algorithm, used in modern cloud server clusters.
	
	Consensus algorithms allow a collection of machines
	to work as a coherent group that can survive the failures
	of some of its members. Because of this, they play a
	key role in building reliable large-scale software systems.

This Dezyne model is based on the paper [In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm (Extended Version)](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout.
